## About the conference

As a satellite meeting of the WATOC 2025 conference, this event continues the tradition of presenting foundational and applied advances in numerical methods in quantum chemistry and chemical physics. This year, we are especially excited to highlight topics in light-matter interactions and relativistic effects. The event is structured as a series of invited presentations, a few contributed presentations, and a poster session, which we believe will be of interest for PhD students and young researchers.

The conference will be held at [Humboldt University](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de) in Adlershof in [Berlin, Germany](https://www.visitberlin.de/) in the [Erwin-Schr√∂dinger-Zentrum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fqv1HcU8uQYAiYcN7). The event will start on Wednesday the 18.06.2025 at 9.00am and will terminate on Friday the 20.06.2025 at 6.00pm. The program will be available shortly on our website.
To keep the conference as affordable as possible, we will keep the conference fees low and we will provide a small lunch for all participants during the three days of the conference.

## Commute and Public Transport

Adlershof is located in south-east of Berlin. It is well connected by public transportation through S-Bahn and Trams/Bus [https://www.bvg.de/en](https://www.bvg.de/en). It takes 30 minutes to reach from the city-centre (S9) and 15 -20 minutes from airport (S9, S46).

There is a number of ticket options available, including 7-day tickets valid for all modes of transportation [https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets). Car-sharing is offered in Adlershof too. The closest S-Bahn station is [S Adlerhof](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7UoirT2mRQAadh4c7), within 10 walking minutes to the conference site. The closest tram station is [Magnusstrasse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKCVNZCFFv1Kg8pZ7) within 2 minutes walking.

Google maps would be a good option to navigate, but it often gives outdated public-transport connection information, hence it is advised to use **BVG-Fahrinfo app**.

## Accommodation
There is a wide variety of accommodations available in Berlin in all price ranges, including hotels and hostels. There are also few hotels close to the workshop site within walking distance.
We recommend you make your own arrangements in due time. As Adlershof is located at the outer part of Berlin, but fairly well connected, accommodations do not necessarily need to be in Adlershof.
